# Airbnb Clone

This is an Airbnb clone project from my bootcamp App Academy that aims to replicate 
some of the key features of the popular accommodation rental platform. It allows users to post listings, leave reviews, and toggle prices for their listings. This README provides an overview of the project and its functionalities.

## Features


- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile information. This feature ensures secure access to the platform and allows users to personalize their experience.

- **Listing Management**: Hosts can create detailed listings for their accommodations, including property descriptions, location, and images. They can also update and delete their listings as needed.


- **Booking and Reservation**: Guests can make reservations for available accommodations.

- **Review and Rating**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for accommodations they have stayed in. This feature enables feedback and helps future guests make informed decisions.
